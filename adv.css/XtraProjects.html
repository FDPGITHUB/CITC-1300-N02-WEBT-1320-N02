        <h3>LAB STUDIOS</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>"I find immense satisfaction in undertaking straightforward branding projects, and one such 
         memorable endeavor involved crafting a cohesive brand identity. The client sought a color palette exuding 
         trustworthiness and expertise, reflective of their proficiency in storytelling. Additionally, they desired 
         the inclusion of a camera symbol within the logo, aligning with their primary focus on video content creation. 
         Employing a blend of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, I meticulously crafted both the branding elements and the 
         accompanying landing page. While the client ultimately opted for a different direction, this project remains a 
         standout experience for me. It compelled me to step outside my comfort zone, fostering a deeper exploration of 
         Adobe Illustrator and igniting a spirit of experimentation that continues to enrich my design practice."</p>

         <h3>ShoeGameTime Logos</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>This project was characterized by its simplicity yet meaningful intent: crafting a logo/emblem centered around 
          the initials 'SGT.' The client's vision was clearâ€”to evoke a sense of speed and energy that resonated with the brand's
           core objective: delivering high-quality shoes promptly and affordably. To meet this vision, I meticulously curated a 
           distinctive highlighter shade of yellow, selecting hex codes and employing color-picking tools to ensure 
           precise alignment with the client's specifications. The result was a visually striking emblem that not only captured 
           the essence of speed and vitality but also stood out with its unique hue, embodying the brand's commitment to excellence 
           and individuality. The client was pleased with both outcomes but leaned towards the latter. Although I deemed both worthy 
           of display as I'll admit I love both logos too much to only showcase one! Haha. This project exemplified the gratifying nature 
           of creative collaboration, where multiple iterations led to equally compelling results, each imbued with its own 
           unique charm and character.</p>

         <p>"I had the pleasure of collaborating with fellow creative Barney Wells, a talented musician in search of a distinctive 
            graphic to elevate his brand. Our collaboration involved numerous iterations until we arrived at a design that resonated with 
            him. The entire process was both enriching and enjoyable, providing valuable insights into meeting and exceeding client expectations. 
            Additionally, I had the opportunity to explore and create some of my favorite 'Xtra/Throwaway' graphics, which I am delighted to showcase 
            today. While the final image chosen was the one that best represented Barney's vision, I'm immensely grateful for the chance to collaborate 
            with such a dynamic and creative individual as Mr. Barney Wells."</p>
