        <h3>DRC Project</h3>
       <p>"While residing in my hometown of Dickson, TN, I had the privilege of 
        undertaking a significant project: designing posters showcasing menu 
        items for a newly established restaurant joining the local community. 
        The establishment, known as 'Desert Rose Cantina,' boasted a specialization 
        in TexMex Southern-style cuisine. Among the culinary delights, the tacos 
        stood out as an absolute sensation. Recognizing their prominence, I endeavored 
        to infuse these menu items with distinctive character and allure. 
        Collaborating with fellow creatives and drawing inspiration from the evocative 
        essence of the Southern desert, I crafted a series of 17 captivating posters. 
        Among these, I've selected some personal favorites to share with you. I trust 
        you'll find them as enjoyable as I did creating them.</p>

        <h3>Fredobytes</h3>
       <p>"I initiated the @fredobytes Instagram page inspired by a TikTok I stumbled upon. The creator 
        shared their remarkable progress achieved through consistent daily design practice, instilling 
        in me a fervent dedication to growth. Thus, fredobytes was born, with 'Byte' in its name symbolizing
         digital storage units like 'gigabytes' and 'megabytes,' while also conveying the notion of 'biting' into 
         the world as an artist. This platform serves as my personal accountability tool, allowing me to chart my evolution 
         in the realm of design. Embracing disciplined posting schedules, I've witnessed substantial progress and development, 
         turning this endeavor into my primary passion project. I take immense pride in the journey and accomplishments 
         reflected through this page."</p>

        <h3>Timeless Decor</h3>
       <p>"This project served as a pivotal lesson in understanding the essence of brand identity. In guiding the owner of an apartment 
        decor company through two distinct brand directions, I inadvertently embarked on a journey of self-discovery in visual brand identity. 
        Despite the subtle differences between the two concepts, the decision carried significant weight, as it would ultimately shape the 
        trajectory of the evolving brand, rendering it unrecognizable from its initial inception. Opting for one direction over the other, 
        the owner leveraged the guidelines provided to propel his company forward, crafting content and promoting it to the public. Despite 
        being early in my design career, this project played an instrumental role in my growth as a designer, underscoring the importance of 
        strategic brand development and laying a solid foundation for future endeavors."</p>
