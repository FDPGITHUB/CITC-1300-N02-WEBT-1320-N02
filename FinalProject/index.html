        <h3>DRC Project</h3>
       <p>"While residing in my hometown of Dickson, TN, I had the privilege of 
        undertaking a significant project: designing posters showcasing menu 
        items for a newly established restaurant joining the local community. 
        The establishment, known as 'Desert Rose Cantina,' boasted a specialization 
        in TexMex Southern-style cuisine. Among the culinary delights, the tacos 
        stood out as an absolute sensation. Recognizing their prominence, I endeavored 
        to infuse these menu items with distinctive character and allure. 
        Collaborating with fellow creatives and drawing inspiration from the evocative 
        essence of the Southern desert, I crafted a series of 17 captivating posters. 
        Among these, I've selected some personal favorites to share with you. I trust 
        you'll find them as enjoyable as I did creating them.</p>

        <h3>Fredobytes</h3>
       <p>"I initiated the @fredobytes Instagram page inspired by a TikTok I stumbled upon. The creator 
        shared their remarkable progress achieved through consistent daily design practice, instilling 
        in me a fervent dedication to growth. Thus, fredobytes was born, with 'Byte' in its name symbolizing
         digital storage units like 'gigabytes' and 'megabytes,' while also conveying the notion of 'biting' into 
         the world as an artist. This platform serves as my personal accountability tool, allowing me to chart my evolution 
         in the realm of design. Embracing disciplined posting schedules, I've witnessed substantial progress and development, 
         turning this endeavor into my primary passion project. I take immense pride in the journey and accomplishments 
         reflected through this page."</p>
